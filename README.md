# Online Quiz Application (Java Console-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview

The Online Quiz Application is a console-based Java project that allows users to attempt multiple-choice questions (MCQs). 
The system displays questions one by one, accepts user input, evaluates answers, calculates the total score, and shows the final result with a performance message.

This project is developed to demonstrate core Java programming concepts and logical implementation skills.
